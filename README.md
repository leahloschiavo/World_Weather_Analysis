Both WeatherPy and VacationPy are under the VacationPy starter code. I'm not sure how this happened but since the API's were still working and the path was right, I didn't want to correct it. 
They are both listed under "Final" for each title. I tend to have several drafts of my assignments.

I received help from the ask ABC assistants -- although not as much as before -- which I'm proud of!  
I also use the ChatGPT but many times it's to help with error codes. Most of the time anything I get from them is a guide.
I had a tutoring session and we went over how to upload the api and make sure everythign was reading correctly. 
I did look over past assignments to get guidance on how to put in the code--especially for WeatherPy but nothing should be exact. 

Thanks!
